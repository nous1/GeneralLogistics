## Project Nous - First Meeting Results

General Aspects:
- The initiative to create a collaborative effort to develop unexplored potentials is proposed. 
- Matias proposes 6 axes that manifest themselves as macro areas from which it would be good to learn.
Artificial Intelligence.
  - Web Development as a tool (Global Impact) (to be explored)
  - Cryptography
  - Quantum Computing
  - Computer Graphics
  - Computing applied to Psychology.
- It's argued that A.I is the main entry point to potentially all of these topics and is seen by us as the root of the project.
- We agree that we have to have sharp and clear goals, so we plan to define a series of future projects with specific goals.
- Machine Learning is defined as an entry point to the world of Artificial Intelligence.
- The initial and general goal is to acquire **_Intuition_** with respect to A.I.

Logistics:
- We agree that we have to be constant in our collaboration.
- We agree to name the project since the beginning, and the name 'Nous' is accepted and defined.
- We agree to adopt a methodology consistent with two-week cycles at the end of which we should:
Have delivered the results of the current cycle.
Define the specific goals for the next cycle.
Document the events, progress and relevant markups of the cycle.
- We agree to define a minimum of 5 total work hours a week allocated to the project.
- We agree to allocate 2 hours at the most, from the previous 5, to work together in the week, therefore, we agree to schedule **two one-hour meetings** a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 8pm to 9pm.

**Next meeting scheduled to Thursday, March 22, 2018. In which we should define the start and end day of the cycles, and our goal for the first cycle.**

___

- Idea: Prediction and Decision-Making Project with Business Intelligence; previous projects with goals in the same line but more basic ones. 
- Idea: Point toward an area where the utility of Machine Learning has already been proved and reutilize the already discovered knowledge for goals of our own.
- Idea: Create a lucrative project (It would be a good motivation factor and a source of objective feedback and proof of advancement)
- Idea: To show 3 possible applications of Machine Learning.
