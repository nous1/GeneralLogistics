## Nous Project - Second Meeting Results

#### Pending Tasks Progress/Results
- 3 Possible ML applications:
  - The document 'ML&AI topics' was produced, with a list of 6 successful ML applications
  and 56 areas in which AI has important development.
  - An agreement was reached about the need for focusing on finding datasets instead of researching existing 
  successful projects, because those successes would not inform us what we will be able to do now.
  Those datasets will give us intuition over the initial stages of an ML project, and insight on the projects
  we should follow next.
  
  
#### Assigned Tasks
_Future_:
- Both of us
  - First project: Credit Scoring predictive classification
    - It came as the first homework given for the Universidad de Chile "Laboraboratorio de inteligencia Computacional" course.
  - It will be started after some preparation on ML described below.
  
_For April 2_:
- Cristopher
  - Installation of scikit-learn python library for ML development.
  - Scikit-learn tutorials on Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and K-Means.
- Matias
  - Review at least 10 tutorials on statistic analysis, ML oriented.
  - Select 3 of them for next preparation stages.
